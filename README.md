# gamestack

## Project Details 
*gamestack* is a website where users can register accounts and list the video games they own in their collection. 
Users are able to add and remove games from their 'stack', and also view the 'stacks' of other users. 
It features safe and persistent sessions, responsive design, and descriptive error handling.

A running version of the app can be found at https://gamestack.herokuapp.com

The following technologies/tools were used for developing *gamestack*:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB/Mongoose
* Twitter Bootstrap
* Passport
* Pug
* JQuery 
* Giant Bomb API

### Lessons Learned
This was my first approach at Node and building larger scale web applications from what I was used to. These were a few of the lessons I learned from this small project.

* Structure the application, including routes, from the very start. 
* Front-end frameworks like React or Angular would have made this a lot easier and less straining on the server side. 
* The plethora of external JavaScript libraries makes mundane tasks simple, but obfuscates logic.
Consider writing the code at a low level first, or read the documentation thoroughly.
